# Midea / Senville S-Comms (S1S2) Monitor

Reverse engineering and monitoring tools for the S-Comms (S1S2) communication bus used by Midea-based inverter HVAC systems (including Senville central air units).

This project passively monitors and decodes the communication between the indoor air handler and outdoor inverter unit, exposing internal telemetry — compressor behavior, temperatures, voltages, EXV position, and more — and streams those metrics into Home Assistant via MQTT.

> **Note:** This project is observation-only. It does not send commands or control the HVAC system.

## Sensor Reference

All byte indices are **payload-relative** (byte 5 of the raw frame = index 5, matching the DB column names HPA5, ODU5, etc).

### Confidence Levels
- ✅ **Confirmed** — Validated against physical measurements or unambiguous observed behaviour
- ⚠️ **Probable** — Formula fits data well, physically plausible, not yet ground-truthed
- ❓ **Unknown** — Captured but meaning not yet decoded

| 11+12 | `EXV_Position_Steps` | `(byte12 × 256) + byte11` | steps | ✅ | Electronic expansion valve position. 16-bit little-endian. Range ~75 steps (idle) to ~4200 steps (full defrost). Responds correctly to load changes |
| 13 | `ODU_Target_Hz` | `raw` | Hz | ✅ | ODU's internal PID frequency target. Leads `Compressor_Actual_Hz`. Jumps to 25 Hz at soft-start, then tracks IDU demand. Observed ceiling: 80 Hz during defrost, ~48–58 Hz during normal heating |

## Protocol Specification

### Bus Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Baud Rate | 4800 |
| Data Bits | 8 |
| Parity | None |
| Stop Bits | 1 |
| Interface | RS485 half-duplex |

### Frame Structure (A0 frames)

```
[A0] [DD DD] [CC] [LL] [ ... PAYLOAD ... ] [CR CR] ([00])
  0    1  2    3    4     5 .. 5+LL-1        -3  -2    -1
```

| Bytes | Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Header | `0xA0` |
| 1–2 | Device address | `0x0001` = ODU, `0x0100` = IDU |
| 3 | Message ID | `0x20`, `0x50`–`0x53`, etc. |
| 4 | Payload length | Number of data bytes that follow |
| 5..N | Payload | Sensor data |
| N+1–N+2 | CRC | CRC-16/MODBUS, little-endian |
| N+3 | Padding | `0x00` — present only on `direction 01` frames |

### Checksum

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Algorithm | CRC-16/MODBUS |
| Polynomial (reflected) | `0xA001` |
| Initial value | `0xFFFF` |
| Bit order | LSB-first (reflected) |

### Message Cycle

Captured traffic shows a repeating exchange between ODU and IDU:

```
20 → 21 → 20 → 50 → 20 → 51 → 20 → 52 → 20 → 53 → 20 → 91
```

Message `20` is a high-frequency core telemetry frame. The `50`–`53` series rotates through extended diagnostic data.

### Example Captures

```
13:51:42.853  ODU (0001)  ID:20  A00001200C120F000077742604B5010001001D51
13:51:42.946  IDU (0100)  ID:20  A00100200C11010F000000170F6C60190000E7B400

## Home Assistant Integration

Parsed telemetry is published to Home Assistant via MQTT discovery. Sensors appear automatically under a `Senville Heat Pump` device in the HA device registry.

The publisher uses send-on-change logic with a 60-second heartbeat to keep values fresh without flooding the broker.

**Example metrics visible in HA:**

- Compressor Hz (actual vs. target)
- EXV position
- Bus voltage (AC in, DC bus, inverter)
- All temperature sensors
- Fan RPM (actual vs. target)
- PID error terms
- Runtime clock

---

## Database Logging

Frames are logged to a daily-rotating SQLite database under `SQLITE_DB_DIR`. A `latest.db` symlink is maintained for easy Grafana integration.

Each row captures a complete message cycle — one snapshot of all six frame types combined — timestamped at the moment the cycle completes.

## Hardware

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Waveshare RS485-to-Ethernet | Passive bus tap via TCP stream |
| S1/S2 HVAC wires | RS485 differential pair |

> **⚡ Bus Voltage — Important:** On this system the S1/S2 lines run at **5V**. This is specific to central air configurations where the indoor and outdoor units have **separate mains power supplies**. Most mini-split and single-power-supply units run their S-Comms bus at significantly higher voltages. Do not assume 5V — always measure before connecting any interface hardware.

## ⚠️ Safety Notice

HVAC inverter systems may expose mains voltage on communication terminals depending on system design. Improper probing of HVAC control boards can result in serious injury, equipment damage, or voided warranties.

This project was developed on a **central air unit where the indoor and outdoor units are on separate mains circuits**. This is why the S1/S2 bus on this system measures at **5V**. Many other Midea-based systems — particularly mini-splits where both units share a single power supply — run their S-Comms bus at much higher voltages and may present hazardous potentials on those same terminals.

**Always measure bus voltage and verify electrical conditions before connecting any interface hardware.**
